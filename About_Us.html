    <p>Ansh Raj also known as TheWereVamp is the one who came up with the creative idea of TheWereVamp Co.
        The name has a unique meaning to it. Ansh has been a lover for Werewolves, meanwhile his girlfriend 
        was a lover for Vampires, out of love Ansh decided to have the name idea as WereVamp, but it lacked the 
        sense of uniqueness that is why, they decided to go with TheWereVamp so show case their love for vampires
        werewolves.
        <br>
        Ansh loves to learn new things from his surroundings, his fellow members and from internet, his main motive
        to create such channels was to learn new things and to teach his learning to others. Although few channels
        are mostly around his creativity side showing how creative minded he is. All the scripts and all the basic
        editing is done by him himself, it just shows how he take care of everything till it is out for public.
